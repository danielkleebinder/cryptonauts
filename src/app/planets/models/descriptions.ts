  'is said, that Crypton was once part of a larger solar system and habitable. Its green color comes from a very rare ' +
  'species of algae that lives in the upper parts of the atmosphere. Due to Cryptons relatively low mass and gravity, ' +

  'super-earth sized planet. Etherra was allegedly created outside this universe. The so called "Buterin"-collapse of ' +
  'a super-massive black hole catapulted this planet into the Cryptoverse. It is said, that billions and billions of ' +
  'years ago, Etherra was the home of some super intelligent species that malformed the multiverse in a way that allowed ' +
  'space diamonds to form in the first place. Ancient readings that seem to occur on specific places on the planet suggest, ' +
  'that the first space diamonds where gigantic constructs used to create seemingly endless amounts of power. It is yet ' +
  'unknown from where this energy comes from and why it seems to break the fundamental theorem of thermodynamics. So tell ' +
  'me, where when not there should one look for space diamonds?';
